      <h2>How do I get started?</h2>

      <p>The best way to get started is to show up to our meetings. We generally shoot for a split meeting format. The first hour we will present a topic to the members. The second hour is for them to explore that topic on their own laptop to gain experience.</p>
      <p>Before you attend your first meeting, it is recommended you follow our <a href="#">Developer Setup Tutorial</a> so you can be productive as soon as you start.</p>
      <p>You may also want to familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby Programming Language</a> or look over our past meeting materials to familarize yourself with the topics you have missed.</p>
      <p>We hang out in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cwdg">#cwdg</a>, an IRC channel on Freenode. Feel free to ask questions and join in discussions.</p>
      <p>If you do nothing else, <a href="http://eepurl.com/GBJFv">Sign Up For The Mailing List</a> so we can let you know about all the sweet things.</p>
